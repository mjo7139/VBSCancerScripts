This repo contains 3 very easy to use scripts written in Visual Basic Scripting. Each one designed to hinder blue team in a unique and frustrating manor. 

- keyboardSpam.vbs

This script spams the keyboard with "Go Panthers!" Constantly

- popupSpam.vbs

This script constantly opens prompts stating "My lord and savior Bryce Young is goated

- ttsSpam.vbs

This script does the most out of all of them. It constantly increases the volume of the machine. Constantly opens up command prompt and types nonsense phrases into them. And constantly plays text to speech saying "6, 7!"

- trigger.vbs

This script combines all of them running them all at once. 

In order to trigger these, simply put them on the machine and run trigger, and all of them will be activated simultaneously. In order to stop them someone has to go into Task manager and find the "Microsoft Windows Based Service" process and end it. With my own testing I was able to deactivate this even with them all running although it is not easy.
